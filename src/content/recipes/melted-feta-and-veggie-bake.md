This is called Melted Feta and Veggie Bake, but feta doesn’t melt lol. This was so unexpected zingy and flavorful. The tang of the feta with the veggies and tomatoes with a hit of jalapeño pepper heat. It really sets your tastebuds wanting seconds.

Again you can add cooked chicken breast For meat protein but its very tasty and filling without meat.
